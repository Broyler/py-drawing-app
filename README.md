## Installation

This section is about setting up a virtual environment if you have Python installed already. If not, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

 1. Download the source code, or clone the repository: `https://github.com/Broyler/py-drawing-app`
 2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
 3. Activate the virtual environment:
				- On Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
				- On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` 
4. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you have everything set up, you can run the project.
